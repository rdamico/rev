# Wildgoose Technical Interview Exercise

We'd like you to improve the dashboard for "Ugly Duckling Events" - a small demo app we use as a pretext during interviews.  It is a dashboard to manage and view a list of events.

To prepare for the technical interview, we'd like you to add the following feature to the app:

    As a user,
    I can filter and search through events,
    by customer, event theme and date range

You should use sensible defaults, and use your best judgement on how and where these filters are presented.  It might also be useful to allow selection of a group of customers or themes, rather than just one.

If you have time left (optional!), please also add or consider this feature:

    As a user and given a specific event,
    I can assign a freelancer to an event

Considerations should be made to help make this an intuitive process.  Also consider how to overcome common logistical problems, such as double-booking of freelancers.

You're most welcome to use any resource to work on this (be it documentation or third party code); we only ask that you don't use outside help or just copy someone else's code.

Apologies if I am stating the obvious, but we'd like your code to be of production-quality.  In particular, you should consider good UI/UX and consider test coverage.  Bonus points are available if you decide to improve any of the UX or UI across the app as you proceed.

### Deliverable

Please submit one PR with your changes, as well as some notes you'd like to us to consider (for example, your assumptions or future suggestions for improvement).

Once submitted, we'll schedule a time to run through the exercise with you.

Please come to the interview with the code set up on your laptop, and be prepared to share your screen with the interviewer.

### Notes

It should be simple to "get going" (`bundle install` `rake db:setup`), but do get in touch with your point of contact if any issues arise.

Please do not spend too long on this - consider timing yourself up to an hour and round off your work there.

Thanks for taking the time to complete the challenge - and good luck!
